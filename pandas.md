# Learning Pandas on `Visual Studio Code`

In VS Code, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` and type `Python: Create New Blank Jupyter Notebook`

**Note**:
 If `import pandas as pd` throws an error, you've probably running Jupyter on the wrong version of Python. Go to the upper-right corner and choose the version in which you pip installed pandas
